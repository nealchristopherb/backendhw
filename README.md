Overview

This is my submission for the first TCP Backend homework project.  The goal was to create a file that accepts user input and stores it to a file.

Requirements:

Script needed to be operable in node.js and utilize the NPM Inquirer package.

Focus

To achieve the goal a script had to be developed that asked for a user name and password and send that information to a text file (userPassword.txt).

Structure

The file uses Inquirer prompts to collect user name and password.  Then the user is asked to re-enter password. The script returns an error message asking for re-submission if the passwords do not match and then finally passes the data on to the text file if the passswords do match.  A success notification is added to alert the user that script completed successfully.
